## Introduction 
Spring for Apache Hadoop simplifies developing Apache Hadoop by providing a unified configuration model and easy to use APIs for using HDFS, MapReduce, Pig, and Hive. It also provides integration with other Spring ecosystem project such as Spring Integration and Spring Batch enabling you to develop solutions for big data ingest/export and Hadoop workflow orchestration.

Check out the new book from O'Reilly Media [Spring Data: Modern Data Access for Enterprise Java](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024767.do#) that contains several chapters on using Spring for Apache Hadoop. Sample code for the book is also available on github [here](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-data-book).


## Features

* Support to create Hadoop applications that are configured using Dependency Injection and run as standard Java applications vs. using Hadoop command line utilities.
* Create and configure applications that use Java MapReduce, Streaming, Hive, Pig, Cascading, or HBase
* Extensions to Spring Batch to support creating Hadoop based workflows for any type of Hadoop Job or HDFS operation.
* Script HDFS operations using any JVM based scripting language
* DAO support (Template & Callbacks) for HBase
* Support for Hadoop Security

## Versions and Distribution Support

Spring for Apache Hadoop supports a number of Apache releases as well as several commercial distributions.

* Apache Hadoop 1.2.1 stable
* Apache Hadoop 2.2.0 stable
* Apache Hadoop 2.4.0 stable
* Pivotal HD 1.0 and 1.1
* Pivotal HD 2.0
* Cloudera CDH4
* Cloudera CDH5
* Hortonworks HDP 1.3
